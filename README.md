Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems operate under complex thermo-mechanical conditions, where unexpected machine failures and process 
instability can significantly impact production quality, cost, and reliability. Traditional maintenance strategies such as reactive and 
preventive maintenance often fail to address real-time degradation patterns and dynamic operational variability. This study explores an 
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven predictive maintenance framework tailored for AM environments.

The proposed approach integrates multi-source sensor data including thermal profiles, vibration signals, acoustic emissions, 
machine logs, and in-situ imaging. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques are examined for anomaly detection,
fault classification, and early failure prediction. Additionally, Reinforcement Learning (RL) concepts are reviewed for adaptive process 
control and parameter optimization. To ensure process stability and quality improvement, Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodologies are 
incorporated as a structured process enhancement layer alongside AI-based prediction.

The study presents a comparative evaluation of maintenance strategies in AM and highlights the advantages of predictive maintenance in 
improving system observability, reducing unplanned downtime, and enhancing overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). The findings 
demonstrate that integrating AI models with structured quality frameworks provides a scalable and data-driven pathway toward 
reliable and intelligent AM operations.
