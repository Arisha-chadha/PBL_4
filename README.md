Traditional attendance systems such as fingerprint and facial recognition raise concerns related to hygiene, proxy misuse, and privacy. To address these limitations, my project proposes a human gait-based attendance system, which identifies individuals based on their unique walking pattern. Gait is a behavioral biometric — each person has a distinct rhythm, stride length, joint movement pattern, and posture dynamics that remain consistent over time.

This system uses computer vision techniques (pose estimation and sequence matching) to extract skeletal movement features and recognize individuals without capturing or storing facial data. The approach is contactless, privacy-preserving, and scalable, making it a secure and practical alternative for smart attendance systems.
